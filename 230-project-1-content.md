# To the Bottom!

## I. High Concept
To the Bottom! is Mario meets an infinte faller, where you play as an adventurer who traverses platforms as he 
travels down a massive, potentially infinite, hole collecting powerups to aid him.

## II. Genre
To the bottom! is a platformer; an auto-scrolling infinite platformer to be exact.

## III. Platform
To the Bottom! will be Desktop only.

## IV. Story
There's a simple story involved: This hole randomly appeared one day, massive in size and no one could see the bottom. 
So, naturally, explorers and adventurers decided to see whats at the bottom! Oddly enough though, eventually all of them 
somehow blacked out in the depths and found themselves back at the entrance: unharmed. Now, it's your turn to see how far 
down you can go, and make yourself famous(leaderboards included).

## V. Aesthetics
To the Bottom! will be an 8-bit game, in the same vein as Shovel Knight graphically. The music will be a simple, chiptune-style 
sound as well. It will be loopable, but enjoyable and long enough that it doesn't grind on you after a few minutes.

## VI. Gameplay
The gameplay is simple. Move left, right, and jump to find the opening in the platform so you can drop down, all while the screen
scrolls on it's own to either keep in in the center or higher. You wont need anything more than a keyboard to control it all.

There will be enemies to try and hinder your progress, and powerups 
that can make you move faster, jump higher, or even stop the autoscrolling for a few seconds.
