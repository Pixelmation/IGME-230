## Project 2 Documentation

This project was an issue for me, as my original plan of using a music finder was scraped late, seeing as I 
couldn't seem to figure out a proper way to use it. I scraped it in favor of https://api.chucknorris.io/ which
was simpler and easier for me to use. It was a bit of a time crunch at teh end but I think I managed well enough.

Going down the criteria:

-Is useful and/or entertaining

  -Chuck norris jokes are always fun, so i feel as if this hits the mark
  
-Demonstrates creativity		

  - Chuck Norris Jokes in 2018 are unexpected, albeit cringy, so i would say it's fairly creative
  
-Runs without errors	

  - No Errors
  
-Does not remember last search term

  - It remembers the search term within the instance
  
-Missing controls	

  - There are 3 spots for input as well as an extra button
  
-Visual design is pleasing		

 - It's simple, yet clean. Not winning any awards though
 
-Interface is clear and well labeled		

  - The interface is clear and labeled, albeit plain
  
-Standard interface conventions followed	

  - Nothing fairly groundbreaking, and is generally straightforward
  
-The state the application is in is obvious

  - Clearly states when results are being searched for, found, or when data hasn't been entered
  
-Prevents and handles errors well		

  - I couldn't find any errors to prevent
  
-Interface looks like GIF Finder HW

  - While it certainly draws... insperation, it looks fairly different. only half credit though
  
-Interface "broken" at 1024x768 or lower resolutions	

 - It stays fairly clean until much lower resolutions. Half Credit
 
-HTML and CSS validate		

  - They validate correctly
  
-CSS is primarily in a single external stylesheet		

 - it's external for all but a single line at the content div
 
-Makes proper use of structural tags, etc.		

 - tags are used correctly
 
-Image dimensions and/or file size unnecessarily large	

 - images are properly sized
 
-Code is well formatted and commented		

 - well formatted and decently commented
 
-Code is located in an external JavaScript file		

 - it's in an external .js file
 
-Code follows coding standards detailed above		

 - mostly correct, besides the commenting which could be better
 
-Above and Beyond

 - im not sure if what i did counts 
 
-Deduction if proposal is not submitted to dropbox on time

 - This was submitted on time
 
  
Grade i feel I recieved(considering the -10 for not having the milestone)

  - 70
